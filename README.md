# Mapping AI Governance: A Computational Text Analysis of the Evolving AI Regulatory Landscape in the United States

Visualizations produced for this research are presented in this repo. Full description of research below. 


AI is deployed in an innumerable variety of contexts. The nature of its near-immediate omnipresence across multiple sectors and capacity for rapid adaptation poses serious challenges to regulation of the technology. Governmental regulation seeks to implement guidelines that ensure the compliance of AI with ethical and productive societal contributions while maintaining innovative freedom. The United States federal government has provided limited leadership as it seeks to address AI from a regulatory standpoint, which has consequently required US states to develop individual approaches to the issue. Leaving this process to states provides the opportunity for gaps in legislative policies between governing bodies, which inhibits effective governmental addresses to an already difficult to regulate subject. Insufficient government regulation also gives rise to unforeseeable harms by AI products on economies, societies, and individuals. A comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the nuanced conditions of AI regulatory legislation is required.

 

Across the legislative attempts to address AI, there is a moderately large corpus of legislative documents. These documents, although written in comprehensible language, often cover a diverse array of subjects and vary in their lexical and semantic construction. Computational analysis methods provide a reliable and scalable source of document interpretation and opportunities for comparison that would not be possible via human annotation alone.

 

The central focus of my thesis research involves the application of advanced embedding techniques that assign meaningful vectorized values to bill text. This enables the discovery of nuanced relationships between bills on the basis of linguistic structure and meaning. The assigned values provide the foundation for clustering analysis, which allows for the ability to sort bills into distinct groupings based on semantic similarities. These groups are then visualized in a two-dimensional space by applying dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). These visualizations offer an intuitive way to explore the thematic and structural landscape of proposed legislation. Moreover, visualizations broken down by document categorizations – jurisdiction, state of enactment, or bill categorization – offer insights as to the correlation of certain independent variables to bill similarity or diversion, as well as latent patterns and trends in AI governance.

 

At present, I am exploring the relation of the diversity of bills by jurisdiction to the presence of AI startups and developers in that jurisdiction. A signficantly larger number of bills are proposed in states that house major tech hubs -- New York, California, Texas -- which suggests that AI is more regulated where it is created. However, AI is deployed in numerous manners across the nation, and states that do not lead the way when it comes to AI are consequently more likely to be exposed to its harms. Should this investigation yield meaningful insights, it will inform the direction of the rest of my research which is set to be complete in April 2025. 

 

This work has also been selected for the University of Miami's Law and AI Research Award. Beginning in Spring 2025, I will collaborate with law researchers and professionals to develop actionable insights for legislators on the basis of my research, and look to publish my work in leading law journals.
